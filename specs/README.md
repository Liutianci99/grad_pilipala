# specs/ — Spec-Driven Development

Before building any new feature, write a spec here first.

## Process
1. Create `specs/feature-name.md`
2. Boss reviews → approve / tweak
3. Code against the spec
4. Verify against acceptance criteria
5. Move spec to `specs/done/` after merge

## What needs a spec
- New features, new pages, new API endpoints
- Significant refactors that change behavior

## What doesn't need a spec
- Bug fixes, cleanup, formatting, dependency updates
